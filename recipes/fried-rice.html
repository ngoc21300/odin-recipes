    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Use fresh or leftover white rice for this easy,
             vegetable-studded fried rice recipe.
              We fry the grains in batches and season the dish lightly for a perfect texture and flavor.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>2 scallions</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together.</li>
        </ol>
