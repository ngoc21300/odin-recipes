    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This ceviche recipe, a classic no-cook summer appetizer, works with any fresh fish fillet with mild flavor, like halibut or snapper. 
        Be sure to pick up plenty of limes to squeeze—you’ll need 1 1/2 cups to marinate the fish. Afterwards, toss the “cooked” fish with plenty of tomatoes, onion, green chiles, olives, cilantro, 
        and avocado for layers of freshness and flavor</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh, skinless snapper cut into 1/2 in dice</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1 medium white onion</li>
            <li>2 medium large tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li> salt</li>
            <li> tostadas</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, 
                combine the fish, lime juice and onion. 
                Use enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to 
                float freely; too little juice means unevenly 
                "cooked" fish. Cover and refrigerate for about
                 4 hours, until a cube of fish no longer looks 
                 raw when broken open. Drain in a colander.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, 
                green chiles, cilantro, olives and optional olive oil. 
                Stir in the fish and season with salt, usually about 
                1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange juice or sugar. 
                Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately. 
                Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.</ki>
